      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        At our site, we're dedicated to helping people in Montana find their perfect furry
        friend. We specialize in dog adoptions and believe that every animal deserves a loving home. We're
        committed to making the adoption process as easy and stress-free as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Our site was founded by after a trip to the local animal shelter, Pet Tracs in Thompsan Falls. That
        day we adopted and took home the sweetest, sensetive dog, Bernice. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Our goal is to get as many animals adopted as possible.
        Pretty simple right? We think so too. We're not here to make a profit, we're
        here to help animals find their forever homes.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Thank you for choosing our site for your adoption needs. We're honored
        to be a part of your journey, and we can't wait to help you find your
        perfect companion!
